# Lara Mateo's personal page (WIP)

### Welcome to my page!

This page is in progress, i'm currently migrating my old page to `next.js` because it was based on `javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS`, nothing more.

### How to run my page

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
